# Assignment 7

The purpose of this assignment is to write a class library that will perform a sort on an array of integers:

- The sort method cannot implement the bubble sort since that is what we did in class
- The sort method will accept an array of integers and a delegate that you will define
  - Do not use Func<> or Action<>, actually define the delegate
- Implement three unit tests that will call this sort method, each passing a different implementation of an ordering method
  - One test will pass an anonymous method
  - One test will pass a lambda expression
  - One test will pass a lambda statement
  - Each test will need to order the end result a different way, don't just re-write the same algorithm three different ways

## Reading

Read through Chapters 15 & 16 to be ready for Mark's lecture the following week

### As Always

- Fully unit test the Assignment7 library.
- Remember to code review at least one other student's PR

## Extra Credit

This is a very "academic" assignment and won't have an extra credit associated with it
